Full Question:-
Jammy got the prescription of medicine. Every medicine is k characters long, But on the preseniption the
medicine names are written as single string. Take this single string of medicine names and value k as input from
the user, and divide the string into subparts to retain the individual medicine names in the following way:

 

* The total number of subparts representing individual medicine names are the division of length of
  string and k i len(string) / k and (length of string > k),

* Remove the occurrence of character which is more than one, from each subpart

* The character in each subpart is in the same sequence as in the original medicine name.

Note: If len(string)%k is not equal to 0 then print “Invalid”

Constraint:

1 <= k < length of the input string.
